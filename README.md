# Hitsound Copier

Cross platfrom hitsound copier for osu! standard maps (for now) written in TypeScript using Tauri. Using https://github.com/kionell/osu-parsers, and osu!lazer hitsound logic as base. Was done mostly out of the necessity for some hitsound copier that was easy to use with Linux. Mapping tools is still a really good solution to hitsound copying if you're on Windows.

## TODOs

- Add map cleaner funcionality.
- Fix some extra greenlines being generated.
- Release to flathub.
